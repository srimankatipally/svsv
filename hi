Hey Manish, I understand the high-level architecture, but I need to understand the interconnections how everything is connected in the backend.
In my early discussion shabe is telling me that prod sub is different for Open Telementy  other prod sub, where I can find this details? If I change a specific component (e.g., Keycloak) in the Dev environment, where exactly should I come and change the configuration, and why is that the correct file or location versus another potential file?
While I understand the tech stack from the repository, I need clarity on the runtime system. Can we review the specifics of how the architecture is structured and how components are connecting in the proprietary system?
When we edit or tweak a Terraform module, where in the back end is the firework happening, meaning where does the actual change occur?
If I need to change the internal architecture (e.g., adding one more cluster), what is the correct process and configuration structure I should follow to implement that?
If I make a change in one location, are there credentials needed for that change to execute, and is it possible that this single change could unintentionally affect five other clusters?
For Flux, I understand it needs the cluster information and the source. If I change either the cluster or the source, what internal process should I follow to ensure I can test and verify the resulting impact?
Is the US cluster configuration stored in a different repository or branch? the Git repo or path where the US-specific configuration resides? What’s the  mapping between Azure resource groups/subscriptions and Git repositories?
